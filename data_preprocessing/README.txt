sine_func_gen.py    generates custom sine waves.
smooth_func_gen.py  generates custom smooth functions.

custom_data_preprocessing.py    preprocesses custom sine waves and custom smooth functions.
                                this includes scaling and splitting of the data.

fmri_data_preprocessing.py      preprocesses resting-state fmri data.
                                this includes scaling and splitting of the data + histogram and additional information.

*** in order to run the fmri preprocessing you must first include the 'descriptions' and 'fmri' folder.
*** these should contain the fmri data and the fmri data descriptions.
